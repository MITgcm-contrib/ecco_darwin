**Team Github Guidelines**

When updating ECCO-Darwin code/setup, or anything that may impact ECCO-Darwin: 

1.) Check in readme.txt file(s) with updated instructions, along with any other input files that are needed.

2.) Test updated ECCO-Darwin from scratch by checking out fresh MITgcm code, 
and following the instructions line-by-line in the readme.txt file(s).
